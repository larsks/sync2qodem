`sync2qodem.py` is a script that will convert a syncterm format
"phonebook" into one compatible with [qodem][].

There is a copy of the Internet BBS list distributed with this repository,
which includes a list in syncterm format.  Simply run `make` in this
directory to generate a `fonebook.txt` that can be placed into your
`~/.qodem` directory.
